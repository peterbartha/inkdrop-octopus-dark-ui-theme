# Octopus UI theme for [Inkdrop](https://inkdrop.app)

This repository contains a self-made theme for the Inkdrop app with my designed color scheme for better readability.

Inkdrop provides seamless data sync across devices and platforms without headache. As a note-taking app designed for developers, it is crucial to protect your data since you may store many sensitive pieces of information in it.

## Install

```
ipm install octopus-ui
```

## Note

Inkdrop supports three types of themes: UI, Syntax, and Preview.

- UI themes style elements such as the side view, the note list, drop-down lists, and the toolbar.
- Syntax themes style the note, gutter, and other elements inside the editor view.
- Preview themes style the header, texts, code blocks, and other components inside the preview view.

You can use different themes for different parts of the application.

## Do you want to have the entire Octopus theme package?

Instal the other theme parts with the following commands:

```
ipm install octopus-syntax
ipm install octopus-preview
```
